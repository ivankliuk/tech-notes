SOLID principles
================

Single responsibility principle
-------------------------------

A class should have only a single responsibility. A responsibility can be
defined as a reason for change. Whenever some part of our code is potentially
a responsibility, consider separating it from the class.

Open/closed principle
---------------------

You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.

LSP: Liskov substitution principle
----------------------------------
“objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.” See also design by contract.

ISP: Interface segregation principle
------------------------------------
“many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”

DIP: Dependency inversion principle
-----------------------------------
one should “Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.”
Dependency injection is one method of following this principle.
