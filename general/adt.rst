Algebraic data type
===================

Two common classes of algebraic types are product types (i.e., tuples and records) and sum types (i.e., tagged or disjoint unions or variant types).[1]

An algebraic data type is a data type defined out of a combination of two constructions: products and sums.

List is just one example of whatâ€™s called an algebraic data type (ADT).
(Somewhat confusingly, ADT is sometimes used elsewhere to stand for abstract data type.)
An ADT is just a data type defined by one or more data constructors,
each of which may contain zero or more arguments.
We say that the data type is the sum or union of its data constructors,
and each data constructor is the product of its arguments, hence the name algebraic data type.14
